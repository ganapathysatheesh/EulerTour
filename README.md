# EulerTour
Project to find the Euler tour in a graph provided 

The project is to find if the given graph has an Euler Tour/path or not. If the Euler tour is present, we print the Euler Tour. 

How to run the Project

1) Compile the java files.
2) EulerUtil is the class which has the main driver program to be run 
3) Use "java EulerUtil FileName" to read input from a file or "java EulerUtil" to input the graph from the console
4) The program prints the Euler Tour/Path if one exists
